# Write the function smallestDifference(a) that takes a list of integers and returns 
# the smallest absolute difference between any two 
# integers in the list. If the list is empty, return -1. For example:
#       assert(smallestDifference([19,2,83,6,27]) == 4)
# The two closest numbers in that list are 2 and 6, and their difference is 4.

def smallestdifference(a):
	# Your code goes here
	a=a.sort()
	return int(a[1])-int(a[0]) if len(a) >=1 else -1
	pass
